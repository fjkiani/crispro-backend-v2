## Example: Before vs. After

### **Before (Generic):**
```
Dear Dr. Smith,

We need your data for KELIM validation.

Benefits: Co-authorship

Thank you.
```

### **After (Personalized):**
```
Subject: KELIM Biomarker Validation - Aligned with Your Research on Platinum Resistance

Dear Dr. Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out because your research on 
studying platinum resistance mechanisms and predictors aligns perfectly with 
our KELIM biomarker validation study.

**Why This Collaboration Makes Sense:**

Your trial "Predicting Platinum Resistance in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer" 
(NCT12345) focuses on studying platinum resistance mechanisms and predictors. 
KELIM (CA-125 elimination rate) directly supports this goal by:

- KELIM provides early prediction of platinum resistance (before treatment failure)
- Validates resistance prediction methods you're developing
- Enhances your trial's resistance biomarker analysis

**What Makes Your Trial Ideal for KELIM Validation:**
- Uses platinum-based therapy (KELIM's target)
- Monitors CA-125 as outcome (KELIM's input)
- Focuses on resistance (KELIM's prediction)

**How KELIM Helps Your Research:**
KELIM directly addresses your research focus on platinum resistance. Specifically:
- Your resistance-focused trial is ideal for KELIM validation
- Your Phase 3 data would provide the most robust validation evidence
- Your large trial (150 patients) ensures statistical power
