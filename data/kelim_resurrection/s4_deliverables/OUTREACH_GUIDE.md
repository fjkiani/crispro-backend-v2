## 1. WHO YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO

### **28 Principal Investigators** from ClinicalTrials.gov

**Who They Are:**
- Principal Investigators running **ovarian cancer clinical trials**
- Their trials **mention CA-125 monitoring** in descriptions
- Trials are **RECRUITING** or **ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING**
- They have **email addresses** available

**Why These Specific PIs:**
- They're actively running trials that monitor CA-125
- They likely have patient-level data with serial CA-125 measurements
- They're accessible (have published contact information)
- Their trials are current (not completed/terminated)

## 2. WHY YOU'RE REACHING OUT

### **KELIM Biomarker Validation Study**

**What is KELIM?**
- **KELIM** = CA-125 Elimination Rate
- Calculated from **serial CA-125 measurements** during first 100 days of platinum-based chemotherapy
- **Predicts platinum resistance**: Low KELIM (slow CA-125 decline) → PFI < 6 months

**Why Validation is Needed:**
- KELIM has shown promise in previous studies
- Needs validation across multiple independent cohorts
- Will enable clinical adoption if validated

**What Data You Need:**
- ✅ **Serial CA-125 measurements** (≥2 per patient, ideally 3-4)
- ✅ **Platinum-free interval (PFI)** outcomes or dates to calculate PFI
- ✅ **Treatment information** (platinum agent, dates)
- ✅ **Minimum 50-100 patients** for statistical validation

**Why These PIs Have What You Need:**
- Their trials monitor CA-125 (mentioned in trial descriptions)
- They're running ovarian cancer trials (relevant patient population)
- They likely collect serial CA-125 as part of standard monitoring
- They track progression outcomes (can calculate PFI)

## 3. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

### **Email Subject:**
```
Data Sharing Request for KELIM Biomarker Validation Study
```

### **Email Message:**

```
Dear Dr. {PI Name},

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out regarding a research collaboration opportunity for validating the KELIM (CA-125 elimination rate) biomarker for predicting platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.

**About the Study:**
We are conducting a validation study of the KELIM biomarker, which uses serial CA-125 measurements during the first 100 days of platinum-based chemotherapy to predict platinum-free interval (PFI < 6 months). This biomarker has shown promise in previous studies but requires validation across multiple cohorts.

**What We Need:**
- Patient-level data with serial CA-125 measurements (≥2 per patient, ideally 3-4 measurements)
- Platinum-free interval (PFI) outcomes or dates to calculate PFI
- Treatment information (platinum agent used, treatment dates)
- Minimum of 50-100 patients for statistical validation

**Benefits of Collaboration:**
- Co-authorship on resulting publication
- Access to validated biomarker for your research
- Contribution to advancing ovarian cancer treatment
- Recognition in biomarker validation literature

**Data Requirements:**
- Serial CA-125 measurements (preferred: every cycle, q3weeks)
- Treatment dates and platinum agent used
- Progression dates or PFI outcomes
- De-identified patient data (IRB compliant)

I noticed your trial {Trial Title} involves CA-125 monitoring, which makes it an ideal candidate for this validation study.

We would be happy to discuss:
- Data sharing agreements
- IRB considerations
- Co-authorship details
- Any questions you may have

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Affiliation]
[Your Contact Information]

### **Key Points to Emphasize:**
1. **Mutual benefit** - Co-authorship opportunity
2. **Low burden** - They already have the data
3. **High impact** - Advancing ovarian cancer treatment
4. **Specific ask** - Clear data requirements
5. **Personalization** - Mention their specific trial

## 5. OUTREACH STRATEGY

### **Recommended Approach:**

1. **Prioritize Contacts**
   - Start with PIs from larger trials (more patients)
   - Prioritize academic institutions (higher collaboration likelihood)
   - Focus on trials explicitly mentioning CA-125

2. **Personalize Each Email**
   - Mention their specific trial title
   - Reference their institution's research
   - Customize based on trial phase/type

3. **Timeline**
   - **Week 1:** Send to top 10-15 PIs
   - **Week 2:** Follow up on non-responders
   - **Week 3-4:** Send to remaining contacts
   - **Week 4+:** Follow up on all contacts

4. **Track Everything**
   - Use `d15_outreach_tracking_template.csv`
   - Record: date sent, response received, data available, next followup

### **Expected Outcomes:**

- **Response Rate:** 30-50% (8-14 responses)
- **Data Sharing Rate:** 10-25% (3-7 datasets)
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for initial responses, 4-6 weeks for data sharing
