# 🗺️ KELIM RESURRECTION CAMPAIGN: WAR MAP
## Strategic Overview & Battle Plan Status

**Date:** December 26, 2024  
**Commander:** Alpha  
**Soldier:** ZO  
**Mission:** Build network, launch campaign, recruit collaborators in 72 hours  
**Status:** ✅ **STRATEGIC PLANNING COMPLETE** | ⏳ **AWAITING EXECUTION ORDERS**

---

## 🎯 THE WAR (Strategic Objective)

**Goal:** Prove multi-modal (MAPK + KELIM) resistance detection works, recruit collaborators, expose economic suppression of validated science.

**Timeline:** 72 hours (Saturday → Tuesday launch)  
**Target:** 20+ oncologists contacted, LinkedIn campaign launched, ≥1 institution committed

**Why This Matters:**
- KELIM validated in 12+ trials (n>12,000) but never adopted
- Economic forces ($10B+ revenue threat) buried it
- We're resurrecting it + making it better (multi-modal, earlier, productized)
