    "title": "Study of A166 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Cancers Expressing HER2 Antigen or Having Amplified HER2 Gene",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "phases": "[\"PHASE1\", \"PHASE2\"]",
    "summary": "Open-label, Phase I-II, first-in-human (FIH) study for A166 monotherapy in HER2-expressing or amplified patients who progressed on or did not respond to available standard therapies. Patients must have documented HER2 expression or amplification. The patient must have exhausted available standard therapies. Patients will receive study drug as a single IV infusion. Cycles will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",

Male or female patient \u2265 18 years.\n3. Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer.\n4. Evaluable or measurable HER2 positive (by ISH or NGS) disease or HER2 expressing disease. HER2 expressing is defined in this protocol as HER2 expression of \u2265 1+ determined by validated IHC.\n5. Patients should have no available therapy likely to convey clinical benefit.\n6. Granulocyte count \u2265 1,500/\u03bcL, platelet count \u2265 100,000/\u03bcL, and hemoglobin \u2265 9 g/dL.\n7.
