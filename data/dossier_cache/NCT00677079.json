    "title": "Single Arm Study of BSI-201 in Patients With BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 Associated Advanced Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "phases": "[\"PHASE2\"]",
    "summary": "The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of iniparib (BSI-201/SAR240550) in patients with breast cancer gene-associated (BRCA) ovarian cancer.\n\nUp to 35 patients were to be treated using a Simon 2-stage optimal design, i.e. twelve were to be treated in a first stage, then if 2/12 patients responded to treatment as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), 23 additional patients were be treated in the second stage.",
