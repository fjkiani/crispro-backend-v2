Re: Submission of “Multi‑Modal Genomic Analysis for Drug Efficacy Prediction in Multiple Myeloma”

Dear Editors,

We submit a methods paper describing a simple, auditable multi‑modal framework that integrates sequence disruption (Evo2‑1B) with pathway aggregation and conservative evidence signals to rank drug classes for Multiple Myeloma (MM).

Key findings:
- 100% pathway alignment on canonical MAPK variants (5/5 correctly matched to expected drugs)
- Ablation study (7 modes × 7 variants) proves Pathway (P) is essential; SP = SPE for accuracy
- Calibration analysis included (ECE 0.479 for full model)
- Fully reproducible with scripts, frozen environment, and saved artifacts

We clearly acknowledge limitations: small canonical set (n=7; 5 MAPK used for accuracy), MM‑only, curated pathway weights, moderate calibration, and surrogate endpoint (pathway alignment without outcomes). The contribution is methodological and mechanistic: pathway context is necessary for accurate drug‑gene matching; evidence mainly calibrates confidence.

We believe this work will interest readers working on clinically interpretable, reproducible precision oncology methods. We plan to submit a follow‑up with real cohort overlays and outcomes once extraction is complete.

We confirm this manuscript is original, not under consideration elsewhere, and all authors have approved submission.

Sincerely,
Fahad Kiani, Dr. Ridwaan Jhetam
