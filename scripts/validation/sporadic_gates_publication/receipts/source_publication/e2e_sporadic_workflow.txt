1. Creating TumorContext via Quick Intake...
   ✅ TumorContext created: TMB=5.2, HRD=42.0, MSI=None, completeness=0.5

2. Running efficacy prediction with sporadic context...

3. Checking PARP penalty and sporadic gates...
   ⚠️ pembrolizumab: efficacy=0.03, NO sporadic provenance
   ✅ olaparib: efficacy=0.03, sporadic_provenance=YES
      → PARP penalty likely applied (low efficacy suggests HRD < 42)
   ✅ niraparib: efficacy=0.03, sporadic_provenance=YES
      → PARP penalty likely applied (low efficacy suggests HRD < 42)
   ✅ rucaparib: efficacy=0.03, sporadic_provenance=YES
      → PARP penalty likely applied (low efficacy suggests HRD < 42)
